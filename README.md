# Photo Tagging App

## Overview

The Photo Tagging App is an interactive web application that allows users to identify and tag characters within a large photograph. Users will click on specific areas of the photo to place a targeting box and then select the character they believe is present in that area. The app will validate the user's selection and, if correct, place a marker on the photo to indicate the character's location. The app also tracks the time it takes for the user to identify all characters and can display high scores.

## Features

- **Interactive Photo Tagging**: Users can click on the photo to place a targeting box around a specific area.

- **Character Selection**: After placing the targeting box, users can select a character from a dropdown menu.

- **Validation**: The app validates the user's selection to check if the chosen character is within the targeting box.

- **Marker Placement**: If the selection is correct, the app places a marker on the photo at the character's location.

- **Timing**: The app tracks the time from when the photo is first loaded until the user successfully identifies all characters.

- **High Scores**: Users can enter their name to record their score (time) in a high scores table if they have earned it.
